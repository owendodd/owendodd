    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      Over the past 3 years, the Artsy product team has taken various attempts at developing a cohesive design system to
      enable quicker and more consistent iteration across our products. Without a consistent approach, these initiatives
      have been limited in scope to specific product areas and have
      failed to gain traction within the organization.
    </p>
    <p> Working without dedicated design systems resources, we knew we must focus on creating a system that could be
      developed in a distributed manner and whose work could be
      incorporated into existing product teams work as much as possible. </p>

    <h2>Systems audit</h2>
    <p>Assessing our existing implementation of common UI and UX patterns revealed a high level of inconsistency in both
      the design treatment and implementation approach to functionally similar components.</p>
    <div class="img-wrapper">
      <img src="/design/palette/assets/palette visual audit.png" alt="Palette" />
    </div>
    <p>As our codebase moved more and more into React, our usage of components continued to be team specific, and lacked
      a cohesive strategy. These divergent approachs resulted in a large amount of overhead in developing new
      experiences and iterating on current products.</p>

    <h2>Designing process</h2>
    <p>With the goal of creating a system that was easily consumable by a variety of teams working both on design and
      engineering, we focused our attention on first articulating a lightweight and easily replicable process for any
      potential contributors. The result of this was the formation of a small task force, meeting on a biweekly basis,
      and robust documentation for all aspects of the design systems development process. </p>
    <div class="img-wrapper">
      <img src="/design/palette/assets/palette meeting.png" alt="Palette" />
    </div>
    <p>Our documentation was created to ensure a consistent style and framework for all additions to our design system.
      This was especially important for our team as both the engineering and design team scaled without dedicated
      resources focused on the health and continued application of these systems.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>System heirarchy</h2>
    <p>The most fundimental problem for our task force to address was the question of what should be included in a
      cohesive design system. Creating a hierarchical vocabularly allowed us to assess all potential additions to the
      code base based on their specificity of application and their scalability accross our product experiences. All
      additions to this system should be usefull across these products and should work in a wide range contexts and for
      a variety of users.</p>
