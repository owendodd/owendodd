    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      Over the past 3 years, the Artsy design team has taken various attempts at developing a cohesive design system to
      enable quicker and more consistent iteration across our products. Without a consistent approach, these initiatives
      have been limited in scope to specific product areas and have
      failed to gain traction within the organization.
    </p>
    <p> Working without dedicated design systems resources, we knew we must focus on creating a system that could be
      developed in a distributed manner and whose work could be
      incorporated into existing product teams work as much as possible. </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Systems audit</h2>
    <p>Assessing our existing implementation of common UI and UX patterns revealed a high level of inconsistency in both
      the design treatment and technical implementation of functionally similar components.</p>
    <div class="img-wrapper">
      <img src="/design/palette/assets/palette visual audit.png" alt="Palette" />
    </div>
    <p>As our codebase moved more and more into React, our usage of components continued to be team specific, and lacked
      a cohesive strategy. These divergent approachs resulted in a large amount of overhead in developing new
      experiences and iterating on current products.</p>

    <h2>Designing process</h2>
    <p>With the goal of creating a system that was easily consumable by a variety of teams working both on design and
      engineering, we focused our attention on first articulating a lightweight and easily replicable process for any
      potential contributors. The result of this was the formation of a small task force, meeting on a biweekly basis,
      and robust documentation for all aspects of the design systems development process. </p>
    <div class="img-wrapper">
      <img src="/design/palette/assets/palette meeting.png" alt="Palette" />
    </div>
    <p>Our documentation was created to ensure a consistent style and framework for all additions to our design system.
      This was especially important for our team as both the engineering and design team scaled without dedicated
      resources focused on the health and continued application of these systems.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>System heirarchy</h2>
    <p>The most fundamental problem for our task force to address was the question of what should be included in a
      cohesive design system. Creating a hierarchical vocabularly allowed us to assess all potential additions to the
      Palette code base based on their specificity of application and their scalability accross our product experiences. All
      additions to this system should be useful across a many of our products, working in a wide range contexts and for
      a variety of users.</p>

    <h2>Components: typography</h2>
    <p>After an inital round of standardization of our type sizes and consolidation of their implementation we began developing an additional layer of typographic variables. The semantic naming of these variable created more clarity in how they should be applied. Additionally, these variables incorporated responsive logic allowing us to more easily scale type relationships across our breakpoints.</p>
    <div class="img-wrapper">
      <img src="/design/palette/assets/palette typography docs.png" alt="Palette" />
    </div>
    <p>Throughout this process, it was cruicial to continually test these variables accross our key product surfaces to ensure its functionality.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Components: quick inputs</h2>
    <p>Our quick edit input were created to capture information in contexts where experiences must be as lightweight as possible. Used prominitely in our log in and sign up forms, these elements are meant to be as condensed as possible while retaining their clairity and functionality.</p>
    <div class="img-wrapper">
      <img src="/design/palette/assets/palette quick input.png" alt="Palette" />
    </div>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Components: modals</h2>
    <p>Modals are used across our platform for quick actions and to surface important contextual information. The new modal compontent in Palette was created with two size variations, and a number of standardized treatment options for CTAs, forms, titles and other commonly used UI.</p>

      <img src="/design/palette/assets/palette heirarchy.png" alt="Palette" />
    </div>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Components: data visualization</h2>
    <p>An initial bar chart component was initially created when we began surfacing data to users both on the front end of the site and in our partner-facing CMS. Soon after, additional visualization options were added to support a wider variety of data types.</p>

  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Moving forward</h2>
    <p>As our design system is increasingly adopted across our product areas, we have continued to emphasis the importance of documentation of usage, and guidelines, creating a centralized, structured home for this work to live. This work will continue to evolve and be refined as we increase useage and find the boundries of our current systems.</p>
