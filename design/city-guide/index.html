    <p>
      The Artsy City Guide was created to enable our user-base to easily discover and visit art in the physical world.
      The digital experience allows users to follow artists, galleries and museums for updates on new shows, and to
      navigate to these shows in our 6 launch cities. The product was built as part of an on-going partnership with BMW
      and was integrated into our existing iOS app.

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>The Artsy iOS app has existed since 2015 as a tool for art enthusiasts to browse and save artworks, follow
      artists, and explore fairs, galleries and musuems. The app experience was ultimately aimed at enabling
      collectors to purchase works of art via conversations with galleries and by bidding in auctions.</p>

    <h2>Opportunity definition</h2>
    <p>The Artsy iOS app has consistently had been one of the primary drivers of commerical activity while also only
      performing moderately well in terms of engagement and retention. Our previous collector research had also shown
      initial indications of the large roll that visiting shows and fairs play in collector behavior and the high
      frequency and which this behavior happens.</p>
    <p>After completeing an in-depth competitor anaylsis, we saw a large opportunity to create a product with a more
      seamless and comprehensive user-experience, leveraging both our exisiting commerical infrastrucutre and our
      personalization layers, neither of which existed in competitive products.</p>
    <p>These inputs led us to believe that creating a product focused on the discovery and exploration of shows and
      fairs could increase our app engagement while simeltanesouly enhancing our collectors commercial experience.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>To further understand the specifics of we conducted a series of user interviews. Each conversation was focused on
      highlighting the relationship between a collectors commerical behaviour and their show visiting habits. With each
      subjects we discussed what factors influence their decisions to visit (or not visit) a show or fair, what key information they rely on, and what tools they use to assit throughout their process.</p>
    <div class="img-wrapper">
      <img src="/design/city-guide/assets/city guide interviews.png" alt="Artsy City Guide" />
    </div>
    <p>These conversations reinforced some of our initial assumptions around the importance of personalization and of
      robust information on the arists, galleries, and museums associated with shows. They also highlighted the
      importance of social validation when considering a show or fair to visit, something that is being explored in
      subsequent iterations of the app.</p>

    <h2>Exploration and iteration</h2>
    <p>After developing an initial understanding of our opportunity with key stakeholders, we began working on a more developed approach to the information architecture and sturcutre of the app through a series of wireframes. These explorations were continuously assesed by our internal teams and tweaked based on feedback.</p>
    <div class="img-wrapper">
      <img src="/design/city-guide/assets/city wireframes.png" alt="Artsy City Guide" />
    </div>
    <p>Simultaneously we bagan to explore various aspects of the UI, iterating on various components. These explorations were then evaluated by internal teams and reconciled with existing UX patterns and visual language.</p>

    <h2>Design</h2>
    <p>The core app experience is based around 6 initial  launch locations. When location services are enabled users are automatically placed within their current city if supported, with the ability to quickly switch to other locations via the dropdown menu. The feature set will quickly be expanded to suport wider geographic areas.</p>
    <div class="img-wrapper">
      <img src="/design/city-guide/assets/city and switcher.png" alt="Artsy City Guide" />
    </div>
    <p>The home view of each city offers a variety of entry points into the wide range of shows and events, broken down into time sensitive, personalized, and curated content buckets.</p>
    <div class="img-wrapper">
      <img src="/design/city-guide/assets/city guide home organization.png" alt="Artsy City Guide" />
    </div>
    <p>The map view for each city allows users to quickly place themselves in relation to the events around them. Specific UI considerations were implemented to allow for easy browsing of mulitiple events in particularly dense areas.</p>
    <div class="img-wrapper">
      <img src="/design/city-guide/assets/city guide map.png" alt="Artsy City Guide" />
    </div>
    <p>New fair views allow users to browse and search by artists, exhibitors (galleries), or works. Additional information about the fair location and other programming is also easily accesible on the overview page.</p>
    <div class="img-wrapper">
      <img src="/design/city-guide/assets/city guide fair.png" alt="Artsy City Guide" />
    </div>
    <p>The show view surfaces key information about the show and highlights any works that are part of the show whenever available. This view is integrated with our existing artist and artwork infrastructure.</p>

    <h2>Analysis</h2>
    <p>While results are still preliminary, since the launch of the app we have surpased our initial goals with regard to account creation and have seen our highest number of commercial interations within the app to date. These metrics will continue to be monitored as the product useage increases.</p>
