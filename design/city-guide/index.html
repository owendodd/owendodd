    <p>
      The Artsy City Guide was created to enable our user-base to easily discover and visit art in the physical world.
      The digital experience allows users to follow artists, galleries and museums for updates on new shows, and to
      navigate to these shows in our 6 launch cities. The product was built as part of an on-going partnership with BMW
      and was integrated into our existing iOS app.

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>The Artsy iOS app has existed since 2015 as a tool for art enthusiasts to browse and save artworks, follow
      artists, browse fairs, and explore gallery and musuem shows. The app experience was ultimately aimed at enabling
      collectors to purchase works of art via conversations with galleries and by bidding in auctions.</p>

    <h2>Opportunity definition</h2>
    <p>The Artsy iOS app has consistently had been one of the primary drivers of commerical activity while also only
      performing moderately well in terms of engagement and retention. Our previous collector research had also shown
      initial indications of the large roll that visiting shows and fairs play in collector behaviour and the high
      frequency and which this behaviour happens.</p>
    <p>After completeing an in-depth competitor anaylsis, we saw a large opportunity to create a product with a more
      seamless and comprehensive user-experience, leveraging both our exisiting commerical infrastrucutre and our
      personalization layers, neither of which were present in existing competitive products.</p>
    <p>These inputs led us to believe that creating a product focused on the discovery and exploration of shows and
      fairs, could increase our app engagement while simeltanesouly enhancing our collectors commercial experience.</p>

    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>To further understand the specifics of we conducted a series of user interviews. Each conversation was focused on
      highlighting the relationship between a collectors commerical behaviour and their show visiting habits. With each
      subjects we discussed what factors influence their decisions to visit (or not visit) a show or fair. Finally, we
      assesed the current tools they rely on and what sort of pain points existed in those experiences. </p>
    <div class="img-wrapper">

    </div>
    <p>These conversations reinforced some of our initial assumptions around the importance of personalization and of
      robust information on the arists, galleries, and museums associated with shows. They also highlighted the
      importance of social validation when considering a show or fair to visit, something that is being explored in
      subsequent iterations of the app.</p>
