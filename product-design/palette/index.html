      <h3>Palette Design System</h3>
      <p>
        Over the past 3 years, the Artsy design team has taken various attempts at developing a cohesive design system
        to
        enable quicker and more consistent iteration across our products. Without a structured approach, these
        initiatives
        have been limited in scope to specific product areas and have
        failed to gain traction across the organization.
      </p>
      <p> Working without dedicated design systems resources, we knew we must focus on creating a system that could be
        developed in a distributed manner and whose work could be
        incorporated into existing product team roadmaps as much as possible. </p>
    </section>

    <section class="intro">
      <h3>Systems audit</h3>
      <p>Assessing our existing implementation of common UI and UX patterns revealed a high level of inconsistency in
        both
        the design treatment and technical implementation of functionally similar components.</p>
      <div class="img-wrapper">
        <img src="./assets/palette visual audit.png" alt="Palette" />
      </div>
      <p>As our codebase moved more and more into React, our usage of components continued to be team specific, and
        lacked
        a cohesive strategy. These divergent approaches resulted in a large amount of overhead in developing new
        experiences and iterating on current products.</p>

      <h3>Designing process</h3>
      <p>With the goal of creating a system that was easily consumable by both design and
        engineering teams, we focused our attention first on articulating a lightweight and easily replicable process
        for any
        potential contributors. The result of this was the formation of a small task force, meeting on a biweekly basis,
        and robust documentation for all aspects of the design systems development process. </p>
      <div class="img-wrapper">
        <img src="./assets/palette meeting.png" alt="Palette" />
      </div>
      <p>Our documentation was created to ensure a consistent style and framework for all additions to our design
        system.
        This was especially important as our product team rapidly scaled while maintain a singular approach.</p>

      <h3>System heirarchy</h3>
      <p>The most fundamental problem for our task force to address was defining what should and should not be included
        in the design system. Creating a hierarchical vocabulary allowed us to assess all potential additions to the
        Palette code base based on their specificity of application and their scalability across our product
        experiences. All
        additions to this system needed to be applicable to a wide range of products and device types.</p>

      <h3>Components: typography</h3>
      <p>After an initial round of standardization of our type sizes, we further refined our type system by creating an
        additional layer of typographic variables. The semantic naming of these variables created more clarity in how
        they should be applied. Additionally, responsive logic was built into each variable, allowing us to more easily
        scale type relationships across our breakpoints.</p>
      <div class="img-wrapper">
        <img src="./assets/palette typography docs.png" alt="Palette" />
      </div>
      <p>Throughout this process, it was crucial to continually test these variables across our key product surfaces to
        ensure their functionality.</p>

    <section class="intro">
      <h3>Components: quick inputs</h3>
      <p>Our quick edit inputs were created to capture information as seamlessly as possible, and are prominently used
        in our log in and sign up flow.</p>
      <div class="img-wrapper">
        <img src="./assets/palette quick input.png" alt="Palette" />
      </div>
    </section>
    <section class="intro">
      <h3>Components: modals</h3>
      <p>Modals are used across our platform for quick actions and to surface important contextual information. The new
        modal component in Palette was created with two size variations, and with a number of standardized treatment
        options for CTAs, forms, titles and other commonly used UI.</p>
      <div class="img-wrapper">
        <img src="./assets/palette modal.png" alt="Palette" />
      </div>
    </section>
    <section class="intro">
      <h3>Components: data visualization</h3>
      <p>The line chart and donut chart components were built on top of our existing bar chart data visualization
        component to support a wider range of data types. These components are used both on the front end of the site,
        and in our partner CMS to show analytics and market data.</p>

      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="intro">
      <h3>Moving forward</h3>
      <p>As our design system is increasingly adopted across in more parts of the product, we are continuing to develop
        and consolidate our documentation, and useage guidelines, with the goal of making this work as easily accessible
        as possible across the team. This work will continue to evolve and be refined as we increase usage and find the
        boundaries of our current systems.</p>
