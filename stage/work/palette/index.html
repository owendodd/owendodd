    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      Over the past 3 years, the Artsy design team has taken various attempts at developing a cohesive design system to
      enable quicker and more consistent iteration across our products. Without a structured approach, these initiatives
      have been limited in scope to specific product areas and have
      failed to gain traction across the organization.
    </p>
    <p> Working without dedicated design systems resources, we knew we must focus on creating a system that could be
      developed in a distributed manner and whose work could be
      incorporated into existing product team roadmaps as much as possible. </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Systems audit</h2>
    <p>Assessing our existing implementation of common UI and UX patterns revealed a high level of inconsistency in both
      the design treatment and technical implementation of functionally similar components.</p>
    <div class="img-wrapper">
      <img src="/work/palette/assets/palette visual audit.png" alt="Palette" />
    </div>
    <p>As our codebase moved more and more into React, our usage of components continued to be team specific, and lacked
      a cohesive strategy. These divergent approaches resulted in a large amount of overhead in developing new
      experiences and iterating on current products.</p>

    <h2>Designing process</h2>
    <p>With the goal of creating a system that was easily consumable by both design and
      engineering teams, we focused our attention first on articulating a lightweight and easily replicable process for any
      potential contributors. The result of this was the formation of a small task force, meeting on a biweekly basis,
      and robust documentation for all aspects of the design systems development process. </p>
    <div class="img-wrapper">
      <img src="/work/palette/assets/palette meeting.png" alt="Palette" />
    </div>
    <p>Our documentation was created to ensure a consistent style and framework for all additions to our design system.
      This was especially important as our product team rapidly scaled while maintain a singular approach.</p>

    <h2>System heirarchy</h2>
    <p>The most fundamental problem for our task force to address was defining what should and should not be included in the design system. Creating a hierarchical vocabulary allowed us to assess all potential additions to the
      Palette code base based on their specificity of application and their scalability across our product experiences. All
      additions to this system needed to be applicable to a wide range of products and device types.</p>

    <h2>Components: typography</h2>
    <p>After an initial round of standardization of our type sizes, we further refined our type system by creating an additional layer of typographic variables. The semantic naming of these variables created more clarity in how they should be applied. Additionally, responsive logic was built into each variable, allowing us to more easily scale type relationships across our breakpoints.</p>
    <div class="img-wrapper">
      <img src="/work/palette/assets/palette typography docs.png" alt="Palette" />
    </div>
    <p>Throughout this process, it was crucial to continually test these variables across our key product surfaces to ensure their functionality.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Components: quick inputs</h2>
    <p>Our quick edit inputs were created to capture information as seamlessly as possible, and are prominently used in our log in and sign up flow.</p>
    <div class="img-wrapper">
      <img src="/work/palette/assets/palette quick input.png" alt="Palette" />
    </div>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Components: modals</h2>
    <p>Modals are used across our platform for quick actions and to surface important contextual information. The new modal component in Palette was created with two size variations, and with a number of standardized treatment options for CTAs, forms, titles and other commonly used UI.</p>
    <div class="img-wrapper">
      <img src="/work/palette/assets/palette modal.png" alt="Palette" />
    </div>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Components: data visualization</h2>
    <p>The line chart and donut chart components were built on top of our existing bar chart data visualization component to support a wider range of data types. These components are used both on the front end of the site, and in our partner CMS to show analytics and market data.</p>

    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Moving forward</h2>
    <p>As our design system is increasingly adopted across in more parts of the product, we are continuing to develop and consolidate our documentation, and useage guidelines, with the goal of making this work as easily accessible as possible across the team. This work will continue to evolve and be refined as we increase usage and find the boundaries of our current systems.</p>
